    <p><em>This is a transcription of an interview was uploaded to YouTube under the title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZ5u65MpjI">Joanna Newsom Interview - Berlin 2006</a>. The video was uploaded on 31st January 2016 by a user apparently unconnected to its origin. Two off-camera voices conduct the interview, and since one sounds to be a German man  and the other an American woman, I have denoted their parts by the letters &lsquo;DE&rsquo; and &lsquo;US&rsquo; respectively. I would be interested to hear from anyone who knows of the origins of the video, or perhaps has noticed any similarities between its content and any another contemporary interview.</em></p>
<p><em>NB like the <a href="http://www.warpwoofwimble.com/pages/in-conversation-eggers/">In Conversation interview</a>, this transcript is meant as a rough, unproofed reference &ndash; not an accurate </em>verbatim<em>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>DE: I did some research, and everywhere, people compare you to Bjork.</p>
<p>JN: Yeah, um, for a long time it bothered me just because it didn&rsquo;t resonate with me as true, but, the thing is, she&rsquo;s really good, so I&rsquo;ve eventually tried to convince myself to not mind a comparison to someone who&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>US: I think that &ndash; oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>JN: Well, just that, especially when you&rsquo;re first starting out, a comparison to anybody which appears again and again and again starts making your blood boil, especially if you don&rsquo;t agree with it, if you don&rsquo;t see similarities, just because it feels limiting, you know, but at the same time, she&rsquo;s good! She&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p>US: She&rsquo;s great. I think it&rsquo;s partly because you&rsquo;re such an original artist. And also, I didn&rsquo;t think so at all at first, but sometimes I do hear things in your voice that make me think of Bjork, even though I think your work is very different. And maybe it&rsquo;s also just the originality of your work that causes the comparison.</p>
<p>JN: I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m the worst person of all at analysing, at seeing my own work with any objectivity, so I certainly don&rsquo;t have much arsenal in arguing against comparisons to anybody, because I don&rsquo;t know what I sound like.</p>
<p>US: I can understand that.</p>
<p>JN: But at the same time, she was not an influence at all for me. And so for that reason, I think that I railed against comparisons. But it&rsquo;s alright, she&rsquo;s great. [laughs]</p>
<p>DE: So if you talk about the album &ndash; first of all, what does the title mean? How is it pronounced?</p>
<p>JN: Well I <em>think</em> it should be pronounced &lsquo;Ys&rsquo; [transcriber: like &lsquo;geese&rsquo;], or &lsquo;Ys&rsquo; [transcriber: same hard &lsquo;s&rsquo; as &lsquo;geese&rsquo; but a longer &lsquo;e&rsquo; like &lsquo;ease&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible it should be pronounced &lsquo;Ys&rsquo; [transcriber: like &lsquo;see&rsquo;], because it&rsquo;s a French &ndash; it&rsquo;s a word from Brittany. So I know, for example, what is it, &lsquo;fleur de lys&rsquo;, like the &lsquo;fleur de lys&rsquo;, so that&rsquo;s pronounced &lsquo;lys&rsquo;, so maybe &lsquo;Ys&rsquo; is actually pronounced &lsquo;Ys&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not quite sure, but because I&rsquo;m American, and my record is put out in the United States, I think it&rsquo;s fine to Americanise the pronunciation slightly. Most of all, it&rsquo;s not supposed to&hellip; it has a meaning for me, which is in reference to a myth, but I also thought it was effective as a title for an album, partially because it registers almost as a non-word, almost like an object. There&rsquo;s a real bluntness, and almost like a violence to a really short, obscure word like that. It&rsquo;s like throwing a rock into the middle of the austere, formal, very carefully-rendered record cover. It&rsquo;s packed with a lot of information. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a certain baroqueness to it, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a certain way that it&rsquo;s dense with symbolic imagery and themes and so forth, and I liked the effect, the balancing, neutralising effect of this harsh, two-letter, difficult word just thrown into the middle of all that.</p>
<p>JN: But the myth that it refers to is an island in French Celtic mythology that was built &ndash; there was a city built on this island, below sea level, and it was surrounded by a wall, and the wall was breached, and the sea came in. And there&rsquo;s all sorts of variations of this myth, but it&rsquo;s usually roughly interpreted as a sort of punishment for decadence. A decadency that was covered up by the sea, and also sometimes interpreted as a metaphor for the triumph of Christianity over druidism because the only survivor of this flooded city was the Christian king, who was able to ride out on a horse that could run on the water. I think one of the last druids, I think he &ndash; I can&rsquo;t remember &ndash; I think he was supposed to have been buried, and they erected a church at the grave of the last druid in Brittany, or something like that. I shouldn&rsquo;t say too much about that because I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m right about that part of the myth.</p>
<p>JN: There were numerous parallels, and synchronicities, and appearances of common themes between this myth and the songs on the record. But the title was the last thing that I chose. So the songs are not about this myth, or this island, but rather share so much in common in terms of themes that it seemed obvious to me that this myth was supposed to be the title when I encountered it.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: You just said that it&rsquo;s a Celtic myth. Now you started playing the Celtic harp, which is smaller than the harp you play now, I assume. How much did all this Celtic music, Celtic folklore and so on, influence you?</p>
<p>JN: Very little. [laughs] Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know a great deal more than average about it. I started out on a Celtic harp because they&rsquo;re cheaper than the big, classical harp. They&rsquo;re more affordable. They&rsquo;re easier for a child to start playing on &ndash; I was like eight years old when I started, so&hellip;</p>
<p>US: Are the strings softer than&hellip;?</p>
<p>JN: Um, indirectly they can be, because usually they&rsquo;re nylon instead of gut, and nylon is also cheaper, but it tends to be a little easier on the fingers. But I think the main reason is just that it&rsquo;s smaller. It&rsquo;s easier to reach your arms around. And it&rsquo;s lighter to carry, and it&rsquo;s cheaper, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>US: How exhausting was it for you, I mean how long were you able to practice on the harp when you were a child, when you started?</p>
<p>JN: Um, a long time, I think. I mean, I have no memory of a time in which getting tired was a reason to stop playing. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure that probably happened, but I don&rsquo;t remember it. When the era of playing harp in which I really start remembering things, it&rsquo;s like I was already, I already knew how to play it.</p>
<p>US: I&rsquo;m just wondering, you had blisters on one of your concerts, and you ended up having to play the piano, well you had superglue on your fingertip! Was that the same concert, or&hellip;?</p>
<p>JN: I&rsquo;m not sure. It actually happened quite a bit on that tour: several concerts. And it was totally my fault. I had too much fun in the weeks leading up to that tour, at home. I didn&rsquo;t practice nearly enough.</p>
<p>US: So your calluses weren&rsquo;t&hellip;?</p>
<p>JN: Yeah, my calluses wore down, and softened, then I went out on this tour and immediately blistered, and the blisters burst, cos I couldn&rsquo;t rest my hands cos I was playing every night, I had to superglue them. It was just bloody baby-skin. [laughs]</p>
<p>US: Ouch! So you ended up playing the piano for one of your &ndash; I was just wondering how much of a difference there is between playing your songs on the piano and playing them on the harp, and if you have to practice a lot on the piano, extra, to be able to do that?</p>
<p>JN: No, I should. It&rsquo;d be lovely: I&rsquo;m sure that if I practised on the piano, I would be really happy with the fact that suddenly I could do things that I can&rsquo;t do now, but the transition is not a huge one at all. In fact, I hadn&rsquo;t &ndash; I took piano lessons til I was like ten years old, and then stopped, and I basically hadn&rsquo;t touched a piano in at least a decade.</p>
<p>US: Well you had played organ for a while, hadn&rsquo;t you? With The Pleased?</p>
<p>JN: No, that was &ndash; this is about the same era &ndash; that was my boyfriend&rsquo;s band, briefly, and it was just a keyboard, like an electric keyboard, with an organ sound, but, dang, I don&rsquo;t believe I &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I can play an organ &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever played an organ, not I mean, even approximate playing on an organ, I can&rsquo;t remember doing that so I don&rsquo;t think I did. But that period of time that you&rsquo;re talking about was when I finally revisited keyboard for the first time in about a decade, and discovered that, at least roughly, I could play my harp music almost immediately on the piano. Although, it gets a lot harder when the key &ndash; there are definitely difficult keys for me to play in. But the closer it is to like C major, G major, something like that, the transition is almost immediate. I think most harp players have discovered that with great delight, because they&rsquo;re so similar.</p>
<p>US: That&rsquo;s interesting, yeah.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: Okay, umm, most people who wonder about getting this new record [???] there will be small songs, and it&rsquo;s progressed into something that I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to call. How did they get so long?</p>
<p>JN: Well the record&hellip; the decision to make them long songs was a decision that was made very early on in the process. And it was an extremely intuitive one, rather than a conceptual decision. Basically, the songs represent an attempt to articulate and maybe even organise the events of the year that preceded the writing of these songs. There were four very huge events in my life, at least two of which were the sorts of things that you maybe, at the end of your life, consider to be the biggest thing that has ever happened to you, you know, good or bad. But these things happened in extremely close succession. The hugest one, which I don&rsquo;t like to talk about very much, but clearly is present on the record, is mortality. I mean, there was a death that was massive in my life. And then there was another event that might as well have been a death but wasn&rsquo;t, that was also very big. And then two things that were very good. And I just felt that, perhaps this record was an attempt to memorialise the year in which these things happened, but also I think to hold these things enough at a distance that I could start to make some sense of them and organise them. Because of course, always, in any life that is examined by its &lsquo;owner&rsquo; [laughs], there are always going to be the same sort of themes, and omens, and connections, and poetry, that emerge out of a fiction, out of something that you&rsquo;ve created in your imagination. Life is just as productive of those things as fictional life is, and so this record is an autobiography but it&rsquo;s also a recognition of synchronicity and archetype and huge themes and so forth. So it wasn&rsquo;t extremely important to me that a true story, the factual story, be explicit to any listener, but what was important to me was that the themes that were produced and the thematic story that was floating above all of it was, on some level, palpable to the listener, even if it was an impressionistic experience.</p>
<p>JN: But I recognised very early on, after deciding that I wanted to endeavour to tackle this particular subject matter, that I needed to make the songs long, and that it would be sort of pointless, and certainly vulgar, to try to fit them into a short song form. It would be probably possible, I thought. I think I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten very far if I had tried to do that, because there&rsquo;s an inherent pacing, for example. The ideas had to develop at a certain rate, and I didn&rsquo;t want to leave anything out. I didn&rsquo;t want to neglect anything in the story. So I knew the songs had to be long, and I also roughly knew there had to be five of them, because of the five songs, four ended up concerning itself primarily with one of these events, while still connecting to, and mentioning, and bringing in, the other three events. So there are those four songs, and then the fifth one, which is the fourth track on the record, is an attempt to include all four events equally. And so there was a real&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t conceptual exactly, it was an instinctive, and very obvious, decision.</p>
<p>DE:  Thanks for telling us which song it was, because I was now starting to wonder which is the song.</p>
<p>JN: [laughs]</p>
<p>DE: And I thought it was either the second or the fifth.</p>
<p>JN: Well the second one is obvious-&hellip; well, I think it&rsquo;s obvious that it is a f-&hellip; it starts out in a kind of fictional way, like a narrative, a fable-type narrative, that is probably, well certainly, the most conventional story-song I&rsquo;ve ever written. But part of that was an attempt to establish a tone that I could then globally fuck over by the end. It plods along slowly but surely and unravels. And then there&rsquo;s a moment at the end where all hell breaks loose in terms of the&hellip;</p>
<p>US: It&rsquo;s so gorgeous. You may have answered my question already, because I&rsquo;ve always wondered about the end, where &ldquo;bear leaves bear&rdquo;. If Bear is liberated, in the sense that she&rsquo;s left her former life, or she&rsquo;s liberated in the sense that she&rsquo;s left life altogether? Is that something you&rsquo;d like to leave up in the air?</p>
<p>JN: Yeah, it&rsquo;s a real intentional ambiguity, because it&rsquo;s one of the questions of the record as a whole. So to answer it would maybe not be helpful for the record as a whole.</p>
<p>US: Well, it seems like death, but then there&rsquo;s also the line, [<em>questioning</em>] &ldquo;Bear wouldn&rsquo;t drown,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bear can&rsquo;t drown&rdquo; and so there&rsquo;s this question of, &ldquo;Is she? Did she just leave her old life behind or did she leave her entire bear-self behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>JN: Well, I mean, one&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if this is a [<em>exaggeration</em>] <em>clue</em> or whatever, but a big theme of that song is this blind fumbling and decadent journey: not really a heroic journey but&hellip;</p>
<p>US: A very manipulative journey, as well.</p>
<p>JN: Yes, certainly. But always with the goal being this vague fulfilment, a feast or the ability to unchain yourself and take off your costume and be wild. Even in the end, the bear&rsquo;s fur coat is dragging through the water, catching all the fish, like a big feast. It&rsquo;s certainly supposed to be ambiguous, but definitely is a reference to death.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: We have to talk about Van Dyke Parkes.</p>
<p>JN: Oh of course! [laughs]</p>
<p>US: Definitely!</p>
<p>DE: How did you get in touch with him? How did this collaboration come about? How did it start?</p>
<p>JN: Let&rsquo;s see. I had recognised about two-thirds of the way into making the record (well, two of the songs were completed and three songs were not yet completed) that I needed to have an orchestra be involved. It was another intuitive, but unquestionable, decision, like, &ldquo;Of course, I have to have an orchestra involved.&rdquo; So I wrote three of those songs, basically from the ground up, intending that they accommodate an orchestra. Like that there be a real spaciousness in the writing that I wasn&rsquo;t used to allowing to be, just because I wanted there to be an orchestra there. But for a good while, I didn&rsquo;t know who I wanted to realise that for me. I thought maybe I was going to try to arrange the orchestra myself, which was sort of a ridiculous idea, but I thought maybe I could do it. I&rsquo;d studied a little orchestration in composition school, and I was like, &ldquo;I can do it. I know what I want it to sound like.&rdquo; I realised at a certain point that I would be less capable of creating the exact sound that I wanted than a better arranger, a better composer, could do, if I just gave them really explicit instructions, so I was trying to decide for months, as I was finishing writing the songs, who would be the right person.</p>
<p>JN: At some point, someone gave me a present of Van Dyke&rsquo;s first record, <em>Song Cycle</em>, and I loved it, and by the third listen decided, &ldquo;This is the one. This is him.&rdquo; I totally had no idea that he was, like, Van Dyke Parks of the last forty-odd years of extraordinary work. I just knew this one record. So, brazenly, without realising what I was doing, I asked my record label to contact him. They humoured me, and didn&rsquo;t make me feel like I was being ridiculous, and he, in turn, very sweetly agreed to come with his wife, Sally, and meet me in a hotel room in Los Angeles where I had rented a harp. They sat on the edge of the hotel room bed and listened to me playing these five songs, and said very lovely, beautiful things to me and then agreed to do the project&hellip;</p>
<p>US: Wow!</p>
<p>JN: &hellip;there. It was pretty insane. We worked for six months. He was the person who requested that I start by recording my final harp track and final vocal track, rather than recording live with an orchestra at the end of the process. Because he recognised the fact that I slightly varied my performance every time I played, and because he worked on such a detailed level with his arrangements, I think he recognised that any slight change on my part after the fact was going to create some retroactive awkwardness with this arrangement that he had very carefully matched to the previous performance. He wanted to feel confident that the performance would remain totally unchanged. I was a little disappointed by that, because I had imagined&hellip; I think I wanted to be like Harry Nilsson, sitting in the middle of the orchestra pit, you know? Something like that. But it was a really good thing that he asked this of me, because what it ended up allowing for was a recording of the vocal and harp track that sort of exists completely independent of the presence of the orchestra. I think that if I had sat down and recorded with an orchestra, I would have been really inhibited, probably, like so nervous about making a mistake and messing up and having to start over, that it would have caused a real&hellip; I would have held back quite a bit, and so because I recorded by myself, in this little room in Los Angeles, there was a real inhibition [<em>sic</em>] and freedom and spontaneity. And I had access to the same emotions that I was working with when I recorded them, and I didn&rsquo;t feel distance in any way. So it was very good to do it that way.</p>
<p>JN: I gave that recording to Van Dyke along with, like, thirty pages of notes. Like a manifesto about what I wanted the record to sound like, as well as a line-by-line of what I wanted. He then started generating these drafts of arrangements, and I would hit him back with notes and edits &ndash; well, I didn&rsquo;t edit &ndash; but requests for, &ldquo;can you change this, can you change this, can you change this&rdquo; and then he would very good-humouredly and tirelessly produce another draft. It was kind of ironic that it took six months because the very first thing he ever gave me was exquisite and beautiful. He was a complete genius, always. But I was so particular about what I wanted, how I wanted it to sound, and the mood. And of course there was a real sacredness to the whole process. I felt like anything that was a variation away from what I wanted was a desecration, a huge deal. I was utterly inflexible because of that. He put up with my inflexibility with great grace. He understood, and just kept churning out these drafts until the arrangement was what it was supposed to be, and that took six months.</p>
<p>DE: Was there ever a point in the six &ndash; I think somewhere, I read that you said it was eight months, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m mistaken &ndash; was there ever a point where you thought, &ldquo;Well, this is not going to work out&rdquo;? Or where you became frustrated with the process?</p>
<p>JN: I think I probably was frustrated at times, but I don&rsquo;t think that it was ever because of thinking it wouldn&rsquo;t work out in the end. Because Van Dyke, the way that he is is really conducive to good faith. He&rsquo;s such a hard worker and such a good man, and believes so much in the project, that&hellip; when I was frustrated, he was like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it&rdquo;, you know, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting there. You&rsquo;re gonna love it, I swear you&rsquo;re gonna love it.&rdquo; [laughs] And he was right.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: Was there a lot of money involved in this thing? I mean, he had to orchestrate forty people, I think. Somewhere in the booklet you write, or somebody writes, &ldquo;Thank you for copying, annotating,&rdquo; and all that stuff. So I reckon it must have cost quite a lot.</p>
<p>JN: Yeah, um, there are aspects of making an orchestral recording where money is totally non-negotiable, obviously. So, paying a roomful of union orchestral musicians certainly was a lot of money, and it was pretty rad that my little label worked it out and paid for it. But all the other people I worked with &ndash; Jim O&rsquo;Rourke and Steve Albini and Van Dyke &ndash; I think believed in the project quite a bit, because all of them made it possible, made it easy to afford an orchestra, for example, by making their own services extremely affordable,. A lot of people did a lot of really big favours in order to make this little record label be able to afford to make a record that usually that would have to be made on a major label to be possible. </p>
<p>US: I did wonder about that, wow, yeah.</p>
<p>JN: A lot of people showed a lot of faith in it, and worked really hard to&hellip; you know, this was, like, at least six months of Van Dyke&rsquo;s life, for example, and he really, really didn&rsquo;t charge very much. Word on the street in Hollywood is that he&rsquo;s the most expensive arranger to work with, in town!</p>
<p>US: That&rsquo;s a huge compliment for you, then.</p>
<p>JN: Well, I mean I was certainly complimented, but I think it&rsquo;s mainly a real example of Van Dyke&rsquo;s goodness, and also&hellip;</p>
<p>US: And love of music.</p>
<p>JN: And love of music, and also he&rsquo;s reasonable I think, like, if he works with U2, then he&rsquo;ll charge something commensurate to what makes sense, because it&rsquo;s U2. So I think he&rsquo;s just a reasonable person in that regard. If he wants to do a project, he&rsquo;ll do it, and he&rsquo;ll charge an amount of money that reflects what he knows they can afford.</p>

<p>DE: Talking about tradition: I&rsquo;ve been doing that recently with other singer-songwriters, so I&rsquo;d like to ask you too: you once stated that two of your musical influences are Texas Gladden and Ruth Crawford Seeger, who I&rsquo;ve never before in my life heard about. [laughs] First thing, how did you get to hear them? and second, do you see a line running between them and you, so that you do as part of an ongoing process?</p>
<p>JN: Hmm. I&rsquo;m not sure where I first encountered Texas Gladden. I know I was probably nineteen or twenty years old. So I didn&rsquo;t grow up knowing her music. And Ruth Crawford Seeger I encountered for the first time when I was studying composition in school and a teacher familiarised me with her music. I&rsquo;m not sure if I see a line from them to me. I think to suggest that in either of their cases would be a little pompous, for totally different reasons &ndash; I mean, Texas Gladden was a true folk singer, I mean she sang traditional ballads, she worked her ass off: she was a grandma: her songs were incredibly functional. There was some interview with her where she explained, &ldquo;You sing to put a baby to sleep. You sing&hellip;&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s always a point to your songs. I have the luxury of having grown up in a household where you can just sing (well, I didn&rsquo;t sing, growing up), but you can play music for music&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>JN: Ruth Crawford Seeger, I see as representative of a seamless ability to transition between, and to see no distinction between, folk music and art music, and art music and new music, experimental music. So I certainly look to her as a reminder that such a thing is possible with very little compromise, with no compromise. She was an incredibly gifted composer, and I think produced some of the most incredible work within this dissonant counterpoint school of thought that was happening among her contemporaries at that time. And she was enormously revolutionary and experimental and imaginative, and boundlessly creative. And then she also took part in this work with the Lomax brothers: collecting field recordings and preserving them, and actually totally popularising them. I think a lot of people forget about this, or maybe don&rsquo;t know about this, but she had a lot to do with the sixties folk revival, indirectly, because she put out, in I think the early fifties, this book of children&rsquo;s folk songs. At that time, they were totally unknown to mainstream America. They were the most popular and mainstream outgrowth of the work that the Lomaxes had done at that point. I know, now, a lot of that stuff is well-known, and popular, and appreciated, but at the time they were still just these scientists, these ethnomusicologists, these ethnographers. Their work was not paid much attention to in the mainstream.</p>
<p>JN: So Ruth Crawford Seeger put out this book of some of the children&rsquo;s folk songs that the Lomax brothers had collected and archived, and that had a massive effect on American culture. And then of course, the children that she raised with the composer Charles Seeger, her husband, ended up being Pete Seeger, and Mike Seeger, and Peggy Seeger. It can be no coincidence that these huge participants in the American folk revival were her children. I&rsquo;m sure that they grew up in a household in which their mom had once been this amazing composer and then had moved into a huge involvement in folk music &ndash; their father remained an experimental, big composer &ndash; and they went in the direction of their mother&rsquo;s path, which, I think, indicates the extent to which she placed value on folk music, and wasn&rsquo;t snobby about it, elitist about it, didn&rsquo;t see it as something down here compared to the work that she had done in the art music world. She&rsquo;s representative of a cultural goal in my mind, but as far as her actual music goes, it&rsquo;s very different from mine.</p>
<p>DE: Mentioning Pete Seeger&hellip; I mean, I remember reading about him, that when Bob Dylan first appeared at Newport (not the first time, but the time when he &ldquo;went electric&rdquo;, as people say). the Newport Folk Festival, &lsquo;65 or something, that Pete Seeger actually tried to cut the cable with an axe or with a saw or something. So he didn&rsquo;t see this as&hellip; or he saw some sort of breach between Dylan and the traditional folk song. When we look back from our perspective nowadays, we see Dylan&rsquo;s work as part of this tradition, I think so, many people think so. Do you think that this could apply to you also, someday in the future?</p>
<p>JN: Well, I have never identified myself as a folk musician in the first place, and I have furthermore never remotely identified myself as part of a scene, and have protested again and again when people have associated me with a movement or a scene &ndash; not because I have any disdain for a scene or a movement, but because I truly believe it doesn&rsquo;t exist, as do many of the other people who get placed in that context.</p>
<p>DE: Yes, and Bob Dylan didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>JN: Sure. Although, we all know that Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger were friends for a while, and travelled together, and toured together. So it wasn&rsquo;t like Pete Seeger always thought of Bob Dylan as breaking away from something. He just protested against the electricity. [laughs] The rock-and-roll thing. And of course, at the time, the style of rock and roll that Bob Dylan was playing was perceived as pandering to the mainstream. It was perceived as him breaking away from something revolutionary, and it was certainly not experimental, but at least subversive, him breaking away from that into these sort of radio-ready, inoffensive, mainstream sounds &ndash; what people associated with the mainstream. There was a huge close-mindedness: people couldn&rsquo;t get past their associations with the grooves he was playing, to know that what he was saying was as incredibly poetic, and subversive, and interesting as ever, and that it was almost more dangerous for him to bring his sound to the mainstream to that extent, and still be saying pretty interesting things.</p>
<p>JN: And he didn&rsquo;t, I mean, Pete Seeger was divisive &ndash; he broke away &ndash; he was one of the folks really popularising protest songs. He took folk music, which was often much more of an oral history, storytelling, inclusive form &ndash; he took that and turned it into a very divisive, politically-motivated, left-leaning, non-mainstream form. I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that either, but it is sort of ironic that he did that, but he couldn&rsquo;t handle Dylan doing something equally&hellip; sort of breaking away to an equal extent. I mean, I know Pete Seeger didn&rsquo;t make up protest songs: he was a huge disciple of Woody Guthrie and so forth, but that was all he did, basically, was that type of music.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: I&rsquo;m still looking for a last, very good question. Maybe while I&rsquo;m searching, maybe you can fill it in.</p>
<p>US: I had one question. The &ldquo;Sawdust and Diamonds&rdquo; song is the only song on the album without orchestration, and I found it very interesting listening to it on the headphones &ndash; you described that Steve Albini had a very unusual way of mikeing harp, but you wouldn&rsquo;t tell us how he did it, in case he wanted to do it again &ndash; and listening to it, I was astounded the first time, because the way the it&rsquo;s recorded, your voice and the harp seem like twins to me. Or like sisters, somehow. Because there&rsquo;s a very similar sort of scratchiness around the edge. And also, this scratchiness reminds me of bird wings, and that fits so well into the theme, into the lyrics of the song, this bird-wing scratchiness on the edge of your voice and on the edge of the harp sound. I wondered if that was somehow intentional on Steve Albini&rsquo;s part, or if it was just serendipity, somehow.</p>
<p>JN: Maybe. It could have just been serendipity. I do know that his choice of microphone for the vocals, specifically, did connect to what the songs are about. We talked about what we want the song to feel like, what we want it to sound like, how close we want it to be, whether this is more like experience-distant song, or whether it&rsquo;s an extremely close, raw one, and he would chose microphones accordingly.</p>
<p>US: Can you tell me what kind of microphone he ended up using for the voice?</p>
<p>JN: That one, I don&rsquo;t remember the brand. I actually don&rsquo;t know a great deal about microphones, so I can&rsquo;t&hellip; mainly it was him describing, &ldquo;This one will make it sound like this,&rdquo; or whatnot. The only one I remember specifically is &ldquo;Monkey and Bear&rdquo;, he used an old, murky, RCA ribbon microphone. It was this big.</p>
<p>US: Wow, yeah.</p>
<p>JN: But also I think maybe what you describe is partially due to the mix, because Jim O&rsquo;Rourke did a pretty astounding job.</p>
<p>US: So maybe it&rsquo;s Jim O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>JN: Perhaps, perhaps. It&rsquo;s hard for me to know for sure where one of their roles ends and the other begins, but I do know that Jim fought, did incredible detail work with the mix. For that song, it took him as long to mix &ldquo;Sawdust and Diamonds&rdquo; as it took him to mix the other songs. It involved him riding the vocal tracks the entire time. With reverb for example, choosing, based on each line, there were certain words where he would swath them in a tiny bit of reverb and drop it out instantaneously for the next word. He carved the most precise shape out of this song. It makes me think he had something to do with that too.</p>
<p>US: Amazing, yeah. Fascinating. Maybe it was his thing. That&rsquo;s something really interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>DE: I&rsquo;ve got one. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s intelligent or not, but I&rsquo;ll try. Your lyrics are full of strange and seldom-used words. I think Dr. Johnson called them inkhorn terms. Like the bear, I think he goes &lsquo;spelunking&rsquo;, something? Is that a German word or a Jewish word or something? Where do these words come from? Where do you get them from?</p>
<p>JN: Well, let me see if I can explain that real briefly. I fundamentally oppose the use of obscure words for the creation of something like a period piece, you know, just arbitrarily plucking an older word out of the lexicon, just for the sake of saying something that sounds a little cool. But I think, sometimes, a strange word is useful, because, when I choose lyrics, music is a huge influencing factor. Like, if I was writing these lines &ndash; if I was telling the same story independent of music: if I was writing it as a poem or as a short story &ndash; I would choose completely different words. For that section of the song, there&rsquo;s a rhythmic pattern that was necessary, and it went [sings a rhythm, triplet followed by accented beat]. So the fourth beat of every four beats had to be emphasised, and that was a counter-meter to the one that was being played with the harp. As such, I needed the fourth syllable of each word to naturally be emphasised, and I wanted there to be a back-and-fourth rhyming pattern: every other four-beat-based figure needed to rhyme. So as it happened, I needed a word right there that, first of all, conveyed the meaning I wanted (which was &lsquo;to go into a cave&rsquo;), and second of all, rhymed with &lsquo;monkey&rsquo;, and third of all, emphasised the proper syllable. And so, the only word in the whole world that describes that, and sounds that way, and has that beat, is &lsquo;spelunking&rsquo;. Any time I use a weird word it is because it has to have exact meaning, and not be arbitrary, and say exactly what I mean to say, and also have the right beat.</p>
<p>US: That&rsquo;s why we love you.</p>
<p>JN: [laughs] Thank you.</p>
<p>DE: That was a very good last word. But I&rsquo;d still like to know how old you are at the moment.</p>
<p>JN: Oh, twenty-four.</p>
<p>DE: You are twenty-four. Just very briefly, when did you start writing songs? That&rsquo;s the last one.</p>
<p>JN: I&rsquo;m not sure when I started writing songs, but I know at least very rudimentary tunes I was assigned to start writing, and did start writing, for my first lesson ever. I had a teacher who emphasised song-writing and improvisation just as much as everything else. So first lesson, eight years old.</p>
<p>DE: Eight years old. All very good. Okay, thanks very much.</p>
<p>JN: Thank you.</p>
<p>DE: We could talk about five hours.</p>
<p>JN: [laughs]</p>
<p>DE: But I see the necessity that our people want&hellip;</p>
